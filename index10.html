            Technology is the study of scientific knowledge in order to create tools and processes that may be used to change the world by increasing efficiency in nearly every aspect of our lives. Technology has made our lives easier, and all human beings have become entirely dependent on technology. It is now difficult to imagine a step ahead without technology. So to get an idea about writing a paragraph on technology, refer to the samples given in the article.
            We are all surrounded by technology from all corners. From waking up in the morning till we sleep, in some way or the other, we need technology. Technology, our new present and future, is making human lives easier and more convenient. With new technological innovations, human beings have become more dependent on science and technology. We rely on technology for all our activities, and have become an integral part of our lives. The entire civilization has become reliant on the modern technology it employs. Life and business would come to a halt without technology. It is beneficial to society, but it must be handled cautiously. It is helpful, and at the same time, it is harmful. It has reduced manâ€™s labour and improved the productivity of the work, but it has also reduced employment at the same time. So, technology should be used only to a certain extent by not depending on it completely.
            Science and technology have become essential aspects of our lives. Technology was a luxury at a point in time, but now it has become a necessity. It is impossible to survive without electricity, television, music systems, mobile phones, internet connections, etc. We start and end our day with technology. So it is indeed difficult to imagine our life without technology, but it should be used with caution. If we become too dependent on technology, it will end up being harmful to us and our health. Overuse of technology can also become self-destructive, so it is important everyone uses technology only when necessary.
            Advanced technology has increased productivity across all fields of work.  Technology is our new present and future, and it has made life easier and more convenient for us. Humans have become more reliant on science and technology as a result of technological advancements. Every human activity has now been replaced by one created by machines. We rely on technology for every aspect of our lives, and it has become an inseparable element of our lives. The use of contemporary technology has made the entire civilization reliant on it. Without technology, life and business would grind to a halt.
