<b>Shivaji I </b>(<em>Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale</em>, Marathi pronunciation: <i>19 February 1630 â€“ 3 April 1680</i>) was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle dynasty.
Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Confederacy. 
<u>In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.</u>

Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golconda, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European 
colonial powers. Following the <strong>Battle of Purandar</strong>, Shivaji entered into vassalage with the Mughal empire, assuming the role of a Mughal chief and undertaking 
military expeditions on behalf of the empire for a brief duration. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming 
a Maratha navy.
